# Claude Code Settings Auditor & Fixer

Audit Claude Code settings files against official best practices and apply safe fixes. The skill performs real edits — use `--dry-run` to preview without writing.

## Arguments

- `--dry-run`: Show proposed edits without modifying files.
- `--scope <project|user|local|all>`: Limit scan to one tier (default: `all`).
  - `project` → repo `.claude/settings.json`
  - `local` → repo `.claude/settings.local.json`
  - `user` → `~/.claude/settings.json`
- `--lang <en|ja>`: Force report language (auto-detected from existing CLAUDE.md otherwise).

## Best Practice Principles

Derived from the upstream `claude-code-best-practice` reference (`best-practice/claude-settings.md`) and the official Claude Code settings docs.

**Always cross-check against the latest official docs at audit time.** The principles below are a static baseline that can drift as keys are deprecated or added. Before auditing, fetch the current docs (see step 0) and reconcile any conflict in favor of the live documentation. If a fetch fails, do not guess — mark the affected finding as "verification needed (docs unreachable)".

### 1. Use settings.json, not CLAUDE.md, for harness-enforced behavior

Settings is deterministic; CLAUDE.md is hint-level. Prefer `attribution.commit: ""` over "NEVER add Co-Authored-By" in CLAUDE.md. Flag CLAUDE.md lines that duplicate what a settings key already enforces.

### 2. Settings Hierarchy (precedence, highest → lowest)

1. Managed settings (organization, cannot be overridden)
2. Command line arguments
3. `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal, git-ignored)
4. `.claude/settings.json` (team-shared, committed)
5. `~/.claude/settings.json` (user global)

Implications:
- Team-shared rules go in `.claude/settings.json`. Personal rules go in `settings.local.json`.
- `settings.local.json` **must** be git-ignored.
- Array settings like `permissions.allow` are **concatenated and deduplicated** across scopes — duplicating an entry across tiers is noise.
- `deny` rules have highest safety precedence and cannot be overridden by lower-priority `allow`/`ask`.

### 3. Permission Hygiene

- **Avoid broad allowlists** like `Bash(*)` / `Edit(*)` / `Write(*)` in project settings. They nullify the permission system. Prefer narrow patterns: `Bash(npm run *)`, `Bash(git *)`.
- **Secrets must be denied** explicitly: at minimum `Read(.env)`, `Read(./secrets/**)`, `Read(**/*credentials*)`.
- **Destructive ops belong in `ask`**, not `allow`: `Bash(rm *)`, `Bash(git push *)`, `Bash(git reset --hard*)`.
- **Bash word-boundary trap**: `Bash(ls *)` (space) matches `ls -la` but not `lsof`; `Bash(ls*)` (no space) matches both. Flag missing spaces where they introduce unintended broad matches.
- **Duplicate rules across scopes**: the same string in user + project + local settings is redundant.
- **`:*` deprecation**: the legacy `Bash(npm:*)` suffix is deprecated; prefer `Bash(npm *)`.

### 4. Attribution Must Be Explicit

- `attribution.commit` and `attribution.pr` are deterministic. If the user wants no AI attribution in commits, set `attribution.commit: ""`.
- `includeCoAuthoredBy` is **deprecated** — replace with `attribution`.

### 5. Hooks Configuration

- `hooks` scoped in `settings.json` runs on the host. Every `type: "command"` hook should have a resolvable path — relative paths break when launched from another directory. Prefer `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...` inside plugins.
- Hook `matcher` strings must match an existing event/tool — typos silently fail.
- Prefer narrow matchers (e.g., `Bash` for `PreToolUse`) over wildcards that fire on every tool call.

### 6. Model / Effort / Agent

- `model: "default"` is the sanest default. Pinning to a concrete alias (`opus`) across the team forces everyone onto the same cost profile — confirm intent.
- `agent` sets the default main-conversation agent; ensure the referenced agent actually exists in `.claude/agents/`.
- `availableModels` restricts `/model` — if the team is on a budget, pin this.

### 7. MCP Configuration Hygiene

- `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` auto-approves every server in `.mcp.json`. On public/shared repos this is a supply-chain risk — prefer `enabledMcpjsonServers: ["known-server"]`.
- An MCP server listed in `enabledMcpjsonServers` that no longer exists in `.mcp.json` is dead config.

### 8. Anti-patterns to Flag and Fix

| Anti-pattern | Severity | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/settings.local.json` not in `.gitignore` | critical | Add `.claude/settings.local.json` to `.gitignore`. |
| Secrets-like paths missing from `deny` (`.env`, `./secrets/**`, `**/*credentials*`, `**/*.pem`) | critical | Insert into `permissions.deny`. |
| `Bash(*)` or bare `*` in `allow` | high | Replace with narrow patterns; list the user's current usage and propose a minimal allowlist. |
| `includeCoAuthoredBy` present (deprecated) | medium | Replace with `attribution.commit`. |
| `attribution` missing when CLAUDE.md contains "Co-Authored-By" preference | medium | Add explicit `attribution.commit`. |
| Duplicate `permissions.allow` entries across user + project | low | Keep in the broadest applicable scope; remove duplicates from narrower scopes. |
| `hooks[].hooks[].command` path does not resolve | high | Flag; suggest `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` or absolute path. |
| `hooks[].matcher` references unknown event / tool | medium | Flag for user review. |
| Destructive `Bash(rm *)` / `Bash(git push*)` in `allow` | high | Move to `ask`. |
| `enableAllProjectMcpServers: true` on a repo with `.mcp.json` tracked in git | high | Replace with explicit `enabledMcpjsonServers` allowlist. |
| Reference to `agent:` name that is not present in `.claude/agents/` | medium | Flag; suggest existing agent or remove. |
| Invalid JSON / trailing commas | critical | Block edits until fixed. |
| `$schema` missing on non-managed settings | low | Add `"$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json"`. |
| Deprecated `Bash(foo:*)` suffix | low | Rewrite to `Bash(foo *)`. |

## Steps

### 0. Fetch Latest Official Docs

Before checking anything, WebFetch the current docs and reconcile them against the static principles above. Fetch at least the settings page; the others as needed:

- `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/settings` — all available keys, types, scopes, precedence (required)
- `https://json.schemastore.org/claude-code-settings.json` — machine-checkable schema for invalid-key / type-violation detection
- `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions` — permission pattern syntax (required when auditing `allow`/`deny`/`ask`)
- `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks` — hook event/matcher names (required when `hooks` is present)
- `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference` — current config CLI flags (only if referencing CLI behavior)
- `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/changelog` — recent deprecations / new keys (only when a key looks ambiguous)

`docs.claude.com` 301-redirects to `code.claude.com`; follow the redirect and refetch the new URL. Record the page name + cited key for each finding so the report can quote its source. If a fetch fails, proceed with the static baseline but flag every doc-dependent finding as "verification needed (docs unreachable)" rather than asserting it.

### 1. Discover Settings Files

Resolve target paths based on `--scope`:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel   # project root (may fail outside a repo; handle gracefully)
```

Candidates:
- `${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/settings.json`
- `${PROJECT_ROOT}/.claude/settings.local.json`
- `${HOME}/.claude/settings.json`

For each candidate, record: existence, line count, JSON validity, git-tracked status.

### 2. Parse JSON Safely

Use `jq '.' <file>` to validate. On parse error, abort that file and emit a `critical` finding; do not attempt string-level edits.

### 3. Run Checks

Apply the anti-pattern table in order. For each violation, record:

- file path
- JSON path (e.g., `permissions.allow[3]`)
- severity
- current value
- proposed value (or `null` for removal)
- explanation (one line)
- doc source (page name + key) from step 0, or "verification needed" if unconfirmed

Cross-file checks:
- Diff `allow` arrays between user + project + local; report duplicates.
- Detect stale `enabledMcpjsonServers` entries by reading `.mcp.json` if present.
- Detect missing `agent` target by listing `.claude/agents/*.md`.
- Read repo `.gitignore`; confirm `settings.local.json` is ignored.

### 4. Language Detection

Count Japanese characters in the nearest CLAUDE.md. `--lang` overrides. Use the detected language for the report only; never translate JSON keys.

### 5. Present Audit Report

```
Claude Code Settings Audit
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Files scanned: 3
Violations: 7 (critical: 1, high: 3, medium: 2, low: 1)

/path/to/.claude/settings.json
  [critical] .gitignore missing `.claude/settings.local.json`
             → add line to .gitignore
  [high]     permissions.allow[2] = "Bash(*)"
             → replace with ["Bash(npm run *)", "Bash(git *)"]
             rationale: bare wildcard nullifies permission system
  [high]     permissions.allow[5] = "Bash(rm *)"
             → move to permissions.ask
  [medium]   attribution.commit missing; CLAUDE.md line 42 says "no Co-Authored-By"
             → add `"attribution": {"commit": ""}`

~/.claude/settings.json
  [medium]   `includeCoAuthoredBy` (deprecated)
             → remove, use `attribution.commit` instead
  [low]      permissions.allow[1] = "Bash(npm:*)" (deprecated suffix)
             → rewrite as "Bash(npm *)"

Proposed edits: 5 (auto-fixable), 2 (require user confirmation)

Proceed? (y/n/edit/skip <n>/only <n,m,...>)
```

### 6. Apply Edits

Unless `--dry-run`:

1. Re-read the file immediately before editing (avoid drift).
2. Edit JSON by round-tripping through `jq` to preserve key ordering and formatting where possible; if `jq` is unavailable, fall back to the Edit tool with exact string matches.
3. Never collapse nested formatting or strip comments (Claude Code settings support `//` line comments and `/* */` block comments — preserve them).
4. After each write, re-run `jq '.' <file>` to validate.
5. For `.gitignore` edits, append on a new line; do not rewrite the file.

### 7. Verify

```bash
# Re-validate every modified file
jq '.' .claude/settings.json
jq '.' .claude/settings.local.json
jq '.' ~/.claude/settings.json

# Show diff summary
git diff --stat .claude/
```

Print a final summary:

```
Applied N edits across M files.
Remaining items requiring manual review: K
  - [medium] hooks.PreToolUse[0].command does not resolve — suggest ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...
```

## User Interaction Options

At the audit prompt:

- `y` — apply all proposed edits
- `n` — abort without changes
- `edit` — revise proposed edits interactively before applying
- `skip <n>` — skip the nth violation and apply the rest
- `only <n,m,...>` — apply only the specified violations

## Rules

- **Never auto-edit critical-severity `allow`/`deny` rules** without explicit confirmation. Permissions directly affect what Claude can do — require `y`.
- **Never widen permissions automatically**. Only propose narrowing (moves into `ask`/`deny`, removal of `Bash(*)`, etc.) as auto-fix candidates.
- **Preserve comments and formatting** — round-trip through `jq` only when safe; otherwise use targeted Edit.
- **Respect managed settings**: if a file under `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`, `/etc/claude-code/`, or `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\` is detected, **report only, never edit**. Managed settings are IT-controlled.
- **No git operations beyond read-only queries** (`git rev-parse`, `git ls-files`, `git check-ignore`). Do not stage, commit, or push.
- **Idempotent**: a second run on a clean config must produce zero edits.
- **Fail loud on ambiguity**: if a permission pattern is borderline (e.g., `Bash(git *)` is broad but conventional), present it rather than guessing.
- **Verify existence before referencing**: `agent` targets, `enabledMcpjsonServers` entries, and hook command paths must be checked against the filesystem. If unverified, mark as "verification needed" — do not fabricate fixes.

## Error Handling

- Invalid JSON → emit `critical` finding, skip edits on that file.
- File not readable → skip, log, continue.
- `jq` unavailable → fall back to Edit-tool patches with exact string matches; warn the user in the report.
- Edit conflict (file changed mid-run) → abort that file's edits, report, continue with others.
